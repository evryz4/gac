# Giving Anonymity Coin (GAC)
## What is this?
GAC is the pseudo-cryptocurrency. This repo is a reborn of my very old project Giving Anonymity Coin wrapped in a telegram bot.
## Why GAC is pseudo-cryptocurrency
I think that real cryptocurrency must be decentralized. GAC has a similar working principle like in other cryptocurrencies, but it's centalized.
## Why GAC is still secure?
There are all actions in the blockchain, you must create account to send or receive money, but all information that your account contains, is your name is wallet. Also I can emit coins as GAC's owner, but I must leave a comment why did I emitted some coins. And because all actions are in blockchain, you can see it anytime.
